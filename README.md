# predict-housing-prices-regression-analysis ðŸ‘¾

### Requirements

**The project was developed with:**
 - Jupyter notebook
 - Python
 - Matplotlib
 - Scikit-learn
 - pandas
 - numpy

### âœ” Purpose and Aim of This Assignment

- This is a house prices dataset for Melbourne, Australia. The main objective of this analysis is on prediction. 
- In order to achieve this task, we perform;
  - various data preprocessing, 
  - feature engineering steps,
  - trying different regression models 
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search

#### This project is the final project of the "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression" course given by IBM on Coursera. I have finished it with a Honor Degree and here is the [link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/verify/BZY2WBWJS6C4)

### âœ” Results
- In this dataset, One-Hot Encoding is used to transform categorical variables, such as "Type" and "Suburb" into binary variables, it avoids implying any ordinal relationship between categories.
- A lower the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, Random Forest is the best one. I confirm that because of the data consistency, it leads to nearly similar performance across different models since the dataset does not contain strong patterns that allow the models to significantly outperform each other, which are the possible flaws in the models as explained above.
